•	Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
Four changes have been indicated within the results section above. Notably the removal of ninth grade math and reading scores for Thomas High School remained in second place overall. The removal of an entire grade virtually had no affect on their overall placement within the district. The numbers indicate that Charter school outperformed District school at every level. The School Board and Super Intendent should look more closely into why this occurrence is happening. Its unusually, I would have assumed that charter schools across the board would have a larger budget per student, but the latter is actually true.
